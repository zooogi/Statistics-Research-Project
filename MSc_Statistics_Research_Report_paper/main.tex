\begin{acknowledgements}
    In the acknowledgments, you should account for anyone who supported you during your research. This could include family, your research peer group, other students, research group members, your supervisor, data providers, external partners, any computing service used, any financial support. 
    
    If your research peer group, other students, research group members, or your supervisors made substantive contributions towards your report -- e.g. they identified suitable methods, provided code or contributed a sub-analysis -- you must acknowledge their precise contribution here.

%===============================================================
\paragraph{General tips.} Your research report will be judged on the quality of the work it describes according to the Marking Criteria shared with you. 
When writing your research report you may assume that the reader is familiar with the four core modules of the MSc in statistics. Any additional other material should be explained to the reader, providing suitable references. See Section~\ref{sec:referencing} for more details. For example, you should avoid writing up in detail statistical methods discussed in one of the four core modules, but instead you should briefly present such methods and add appropriate references. More advanced methods or methods discussed in one of the elective modules should be described in more detail and referenced appropriately. 

Your report must be presented within this template and be at most 35 pages in length, as counted by the Arabic page numerals (1,2,3…). This limit includes all figures and tables presented in the main text, excluding the Endmatter and References sections. This is approximately equivalent to a limit of 15,000 words. Shorter submissions may be graded highly, while excess length disproportionate to the content may be penalised.


Before submitting the research project, make sure you read the report in its entirety. There should be no half-finished sentences. All mathematical symbols should be defined. Use a spell-checker.

You will have to submit your report electronically in PDF format through the virtual learning environment (Blackboard). Please name this file in the following format: “CID-Surname-Firstname-Report.pdf”. Your report will be checked for plagiarism via online plagiarism detection services (e.g. Turnitin). 

Note the report submission deadline is a very hard deadline since the assessment process has then to be completed on a very short timescale.
