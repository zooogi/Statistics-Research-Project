A notable theoretical finding is that the marginal posterior of $\lambda$ is unaffected by the prior on $A$, which is unusual for multi-parameter Bayesian models. This property reinforces the robustness of inference on $\lambda$ despite the model extension.

Even under the MAP estimates, the ECDFs still deviate from the real data. This suggests that the issue lies not in parameter estimation but in the model itself: the exponential assumption of a constant hazard is too simplistic and cannot capture the dynamic patterns and heterogeneity in the real process.
