The analysis uses an employee turnover dataset~\cite{babushkin_employee_turnover} consisting of 1,129 individuals, originally compiled to study resignation risk through survival models. For each employee, the dataset records the duration of employment in months, whether turnover occurred (\texttt{event = 1}) or the observation was censored (\texttt{event = 0}), as well as demographic and job-related covariates (e.g., gender, age, industry, and psychological traits).

The observed employment durations range up to about 179 months, but the exact observation window of the survey is not explicitly given. This absence of a fixed censoring horizon motivates the introduction of an additional parameter $A$ in the extended model, representing the length of the observation window.
